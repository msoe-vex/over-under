# Getting started with Rust on V5

This project was bootstrapped with the [Rust on V5 Template](https://gitlab.com/qvex/vex-rt-template).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory you can run:

### `cargo check`

Checks the project for warnings and errors. This is faster than a full build.

### `cargo build`

Compiles and builds the project.

### `cargo run`

Does the same thing as `cargo build` but also launches `prosv5 ut` and uploads to the robot.
